#Address Finder in Map
####Uses google maps to find supplied address and show it in a web browser

* Uses python3, so sorry python2 users!
* Python package included
* Doesn't use any map api, just plain python
* Unless google changes their base url system for google maps,
  this should work
* Need to improve the unit tests, so any contributions in this
  dept. are welcome!


#####Usage

* You can just copy the address to your clipboard and use the clipboard module
* Or you can pass the address as a command line argument while running the
  program.
